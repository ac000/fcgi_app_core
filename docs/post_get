Overview
========

We currently handles three types of data sent by the client:

    GET
    POST x-www-form-urlencoded
    POST multipart/form-data

All of this data ends up in three data structures:

    qvars   - For simple GET and POST data.
    avars   - For array variables.
    u_files - Information pertaining to uploaded files.


qvars
=====

For simple name=value data. This is just a straight forward GHashTable.


avars
=====

For array variables. e.g

    form0[name]
    form0[age]

    form1[name]
    form1[age]

This is how they should look in the html. The numbering is used to group them
into same GHashTables which are then added into a GList.

You can mix array and non-array variables in the same request.


u_files
=======

When sending files via POST multipart/form-data a simple structure is filled
out with the following information:

    Original filename
    Temporary filename
    Name data from input field
    Mime type

There is one structure per file and they are added to a GList.


These are all defined in src/utils.c
