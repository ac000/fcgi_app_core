Optional per user IP Access Control
-----------------------------------

Users can enable IP ACL's on their account. This is done by setting the
'enabled' field of the ipacl table to 1.

The entries should be stored as space separated values in the 'list' field
of the ipacl table.

Entries can be either IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses or networks. e.g

    192.168.1.10
    2a01:7e00::/64

entries can also be commented out by pre-pending a '#' to the entry e.g

    #10.1.2.3

When storing the entries SQL such as

    REPLACE INTO ipacl (uid, enabled, list) VALUES (%u, %d, \
	REPLACE('%s', '\r\n', ' '))

can be used and similarly when extracting the list

    SELECT username, name, ipacl.enabled, REPLACE(ipacl.list, ' ', '\r\n') AS \
	list FROM passwd, ipacl WHERE passwd.uid = %u AND \
	ipacl.uid = passwd.uid

The ACL check is performed transparently via the chec_auth() function.
