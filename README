fcgi_app_core
=============

This is the core infrastructure for writing a FastCGI C application.

Howto use
---------

Rename this repository to that of your project, then remove the .git directory.

You should also rename 'app' to something more descriptive and you should
also replace/amend this README.

You can now continue as you would with any new project, do a clean initial
commit etc...

Requirements
------------

Things you will need to build (with at least these versions or newer, older
versions may work)

    fcgi{-devel}-2.4.0
    glib2{-devel}-2.28.8
    gmime{-devel}-2.2.25
    mhash{-devel}-0.9.9
    mysql{-devel}-5.0.77
    tokyocabinet{-devel}-1.4.9

Build
-----

Clone this repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/ac000/fcgi_app_core

Then you need to bulld the fcgx branch of libflate (C HTML template library

    $ git clone https://github.com/ac000/libflate
    $ cd libflate
    $ git checkout --track -b fcgx origin/fcgx
    $ make

Go back into the fcgi_app_core repository and it should now build
