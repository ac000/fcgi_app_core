fcgi_app_core
=============

This is the core infrastructure for writing a FastCGI C application.


Howto use
---------

Rename this repository to that of your project, then remove the .git directory.

You can now continue as you would with any new project, do a clean
initial commit etc...


The code is in the src/ directory and builds as is. You should however first of
all create a symlink for libctemplate to point to the directory where it's
located. e.g

If you started in ~/programming/projects when you cloned this repository,
go back to that directory and clone libcemplate if you haven't already.

    $ git clone git://github.com/opentechlabs/libctemplate.git

build it

    $ cd libctemplate
    $ git checkout -b otl origin/otl
    $ make
    $ ln -s libctemplate-fcgi.so.1.4.0 libctemplate-fcgx.so
    $ ln -s libctemplate-fcgi.so.1.4.0 libctemplate-fcgx.so.1

Go back into the fcgi_app_core repository and create the symlink

    $ cd ../fcgi_app_core/src
    $ ln -s ../../libctemplate libctemplate


Other things you will need to build (with at least minimal versions)

    fcgi{-devel}-2.4.0
    glib2{-devel}-2.12.3
    gmime{-devel}-2.2.25
    mhash{-devel}-0.9.9
    mysql{-devel}-5.0.77
    tokyocabinet{-devel}-1.4.9


You should also rename 'app' to something more descriptive. You should also
replace/amend this README.
